Notifications are now shown through a serviceworker (since mobile chrome does not allow them otherwise), it's always enabled, even if previously we only enabled it for WebPush notifications only. If you don't like websites "running" while closed, check how to disable them in your browser. Old way to show notifications will be used as a fallback but might not have all the new features.
